    <h1>Graphic Design at PCCC</h1>
    <p>This multidisciplinary degree program prepares students to apply the
      principles and elements of design to create original graphic design work
      in digital media and web design. Students will create digital works
      using cutting-edge software, such as the Adobe Suite, including
      Dreamweaver, Animate (formerly Flash), Illustrator, Photoshop, and
      InDesign. Students receive training in a wide range of activities
      including typography, publication design, and computer-aided graphic
      design. Students will develop skills in clear and effective visual
      communication. Presentation of information (i.e., selection of colors,
      paper, and media) is also emphasized.</p>
